				<h6>Why should you listen to them?</h6>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4">
				<p>
					CNCO is a Latin American boyband created in 2015. This band was created after all of the 5 members won a Latin show called "La Banda."
				</p>
				<p>
					The members of the band are all from different places. Christopher Velez is from Ecuador, Richard Camacho is from the Dominican Republic, Zabdiel De Jesus is from Puerto Rico, Erick Colon is from Cuba, and finally Joel Pimente is from Mexico.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4">
				<p>
					In May of 2021 one of the members, Joel Pimentel, left the band and decided to start his own solo career. However, all the other members decided to continue with the band and are still creating music.
				</p>
				<p>
					 Most of their music is in Spanish, however, they sing amazing, and the lyrics of their songs can connect to many people's hearts. If the lyrics of the songs do not connect to you, the rythms will for sure make you dance.
